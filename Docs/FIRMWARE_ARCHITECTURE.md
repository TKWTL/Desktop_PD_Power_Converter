## Scheduling

1. PD runs every scheduler pass.
2. VBUS is sampled every 20 ms and fed into the PD policy engine.
3. The SH1107 page chain and every hardware-I2C transaction are interrupt
   driven: the SPI TX-DMA completion interrupt advances the display pages, and
   the I2C1 event/error interrupts plus the TX/RX DMA interrupts carry a
   transaction from START to STOP. No scheduler service polls them.
4. A single 10 ms coroutine still owns the I2C watchdog: transaction timeout
   detection, bus recovery and the rare deferred START when the bus was busy.
5. Both software-I2C handles advance one timing edge/state per scheduler pass.
   GPIO-I2C therefore never busy-waits during normal SW3526 transactions.
6. SW3538 and both SW3526 mirrors are refreshed cooperatively at a 333 ms
   cadence (the GX21M15U temperature mirror stays at 500 ms).
7. Every pass ends in `APP_Tasks_Idle()`: the core executes `WFI` unless a
   software-I2C transfer is in flight (its edges advance once per pass, so a
   1 ms sleep would stretch a byte by two orders of magnitude). The 1 ms
   SysTick tick and every peripheral interrupt wake it, so the timed
   coroutines, the PD poll and the UI keep their cadence while the core is
   idle. The millisecond API itself is maintained by that tick interrupt
   (`TIME_TickHandler()`), while the microsecond API keeps reading the
   free-running counter.

All data required after a coroutine yield is stored either in the device handle
or in static task storage. Device drivers do not use a single global status
object, which is essential for the two SW3526 instances.

## Driver register naming

The SW3538/SW3526 headers intentionally mirror the existing SW6306 style:

- `*_STRG_*` — status/readback register;
- `*_CTRG_*` — control/configuration register;
- `*_ADC_SET_*` — ADC channel selector values;
- `*_StatusTypedef` — decoded/cached register mirror attached to a handle.

## Factory ISP reset

`Board_RebootToISP()` uses the CH32 factory boot-mode sequence: unlock
`FLASH->BOOT_MODEKEYR`, set `FLASH_STATR_BOOT_MODE`, clear reset-cause flags and
issue the keyed PFIC system reset. This reset-based handoff is preferred over a
direct jump into ROM while PD/I2C/DMA/application state is still active.

## Implemented baseline (moved from the root README)

- USB-PD Sink policy: SPR negotiation plus USB-PD 3.1 EPR entry and the 28 V
  fixed EPR request path, inherited from the validated DemoBoard stack;
- nine stackless coroutines (`APP/app_tasks.c`); the SPI display and every
  hardware-I2C transaction are interrupt driven (DMA1 CH3 page chain, I2C1
  EV/ER + DMA, GX21M15U shares the I2C1 bus with the SW3538);
- two independent GPIO soft-I2C buses drive the two fixed-address (0x3c)
  SW3526 controllers concurrently, each with its own handle/state;
- USART1 console at 921600 baud (DMA), VBUS on PA7 (75k/6.8k divider, feeds the
  PD disconnect check), full 20 KiB CPU SRAM (no PIOC reservation);
- `Board_RebootToISP()` jumps to the CH32 factory ISP on the next reset;
- MiaoUI (logical 128x80, R1/R3) with dashboard/menu/service pages and the
  UI_OFF low-power framework in `APP/framework`;
- removed modules are not placeholders: INA226, SSD1306, WS2812 and PIOC are
  absent from this hardware - see `Docs/PORTING_NOTES.md`.
