/* Device hooks of the power framework for this board.
 *
 * UI_OFF is the only enabled level, so the display is the only consumer:
 *   prepare (RUN -> UI_OFF): blank the SH1107 immediately - the power-save
 *           command is queued and applied at the next safe point of the SPI
 *           page chain (SH1107_Display_RequestPowerSave), so calling it from
 *           the PM thread cannot race the display DMA;
 *   suspend (-> DEEPSLEEP): nothing extra for now;
 *   resume  (-> RUN): display on again and repaint the u8g2 buffer (the panel
 *           keeps its GDDRAM while off, and the extra flush also forces the
 *           dashboard page to redraw its content signature). */
